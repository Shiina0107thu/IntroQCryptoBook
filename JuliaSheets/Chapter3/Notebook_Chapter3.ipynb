    "In the below we will investigate some features of Wiesner's quantum money scheme using very tiny quantum coins. As you may recall from the book, in this we would like to implement both an ability to generate GEN, supplying us with a serial number, a quantum coin state, as well as the corresponding key. The bank will use GEN, and pass the serial number and the quantum coin state to the coin carrier. The bank is able to verify coins using a verification procedure VER that checks whether a supplied coin state with a specific serial number matches the key stored. For Wiesner's scheme this looks more specifically like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The bank executes $GEN(1^n)$ producing a serial number $S$, a quantum coin state $|\\Psi_S\\rangle$, and key $k$. Here, $k = (x,\\theta)$, where $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ and $\\theta \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ are generated uniformly at random. The coin state is prepared as $$|\\Psi_S\\rangle = \\bigotimes_{i=0}^{n-1} H^{\\theta_i} |x_i\\rangle\\, $$, where $H$ is the Hadamard matrix, and $\\{|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle\\}$ the standard basis. The bank keeps $(S,k)$, and hands $|\\Psi_S\\rangle$ to a customer.</li>\n",
    "    <li> The bank allows a verification service $VER$ that can be used to verify coins. It takes as input a serial number $S$, and a coin state $\\sigma$. Given $S$, the bank looks up the matching key $k$, and measures qubit $i$ of $\\sigma$ in the basis given by $\\theta_i$ to obtain outcome $\\tilde{x}_i$. If $\\tilde{x}_i = x_i$ for all $i$, the the bank accepts. Otherwise the bank rejects the verification.\n",
