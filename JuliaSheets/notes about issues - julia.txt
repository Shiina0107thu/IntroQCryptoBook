Note to self: CTRL-F TO MAKE SURE NO "edX"s or "video"s or "lecture"s  or "week"s ARE LEFT BEHIND!!






- Can not get interactive Bloch Sphere to work
	- Interactive Bloch Sphere issues where caused by style commands in bloch.jl
	  These commands have bein dissabled. The commands causing the issue:
		-ax[:w_zaxis][:line][:set_visible](false)
		-ax[:legend](fontsize = "medium")
		

- Copyright at bottom of notebooks - what to change it to?



Getting Started:
- Link to quant-econ.net broken!! Need a replacement?
- Link to the second mathjax tutorial is broken (http://www.suluclac.com/Wiki+MathJax+Syntax). I have simply removed it since there is already another mathjax tutorial.

Chapter 1:
- Opening para, confirm if it is okay. Should we mention something about answers?
- Bloch sphere doesn't display.

Chapter 2:
- Bloch sphere doens't display for this chapter either

Chapter 4:
- Reference to the Delft Bell experiment: should I remove it? I do not see a reference to it in the book.

Chapter 5:
- SCS optimisation of min-entropy gives 0 for both examples. Is it correct?

Chapter 7:
- Para before encoder needs to be checked. 







Log of Changes made:
Common:
- Rename any "edX Exercises" to "Exercises"
- round(...,digits) -> round(..., digits=digits) in many places
- trace(Matrix) -> tr(Matrix)

- linspace(a,b,n)->collect(LinRange(a,b,n)) in bloch.jl
    can also use collect(range(0,stop=b,length=n))
- cos(Vector) -> cos.(Vector) in bloch.jl
    Same with sin and ones
- Comment out ax[:set_aspect](true) in bloch.jl
    Can't set aspect ratio with a boolean

Chapter1:
- Week0 -> Chapter1
- Opening block of text
- ax = axes(polar = "true") -> ax = PyPlot.axes(polar = "true") in chapter1.jl
- fig = figure(figsize=(4,4)) -> fig = PyPlot.figure(figsize=(4,4)) in chapter1.jl
- "Supplement to Exercise 7" -> "Supplement to Exercise 8"
    I assume this was a typo?
    
Chapter2:
- Week 1 -> Chapter 2. Also in index.
- "Week 1 - From essential tools to the first quantum protocol" -> "Chapter 2 - Quantum tools and a first protocol"
- Removed github link to Getting started
- (rawImage + key_ex5) % 2 -> (rawImage + key_ex5) .% 2 in load.jl
- using LinearAlgebra for eigvals (in main.jl)
- add L before "" for a string to use latex
- comment out set aspect rate in bloch.jl
- Add instructions for modulo 2 of a vector/matrix
- Remove "Not graded" tag from Exercise 9

Chapter4:
- Week 2 -> Chapter 4. Also in index.
- using LinearAlgebra for eigvals
- using SparseArrays in partialtranspose.jl
    for issparse()
- "Array(Int, n^2)"->"zeros(Int, n^2)" in partialtranspose.jl

Chapter5:
- Removed warning about JuliaBox updating their kernel
- type -> mutable struct in bloch.jl
    type throws a syntax error.
- "videos and lecture notes" -> "book"
- "video's" -> "chapter"
- SCSSolver(verbose=false) -> SCS.Optimizer())

Chapter6:
- using Convex: AbstractExpr; using LinearAlgebra; in main.
- SCSSolver(...) -> optimizer = Convex.MOI.OptimizerWithAttributes(SCS.Optimizer, "max_iters" => 2500)
    	solve!(problem, optimizer) in minEntropy.jl
- "inputRhoArrayEx = Array[1/3*e0, 1/3*e0, zeros(e0), 1/3*e1];"->"inputRhoArrayEx = Array[1/3*e0, 1/3*e0, zeros(size(e0)), 1/3*e1];"
- v = bin(i-1,l) -> v = string(i-1, base = 2, pad=l)
- Made use of vectors and their transposes consistent in the parts with syndromes
