    "Welcome to the first Jupyter notebook provided alongside the book ***Introduction to Quantum Cryptography***. The purpose of these notebooks is to help you sharpen your understanding and gain intuition by calculating and vizualizing many elements of the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "First off, <b>what is a Jupyter notebook?</b> A Jupyter notebook is viewed in the browser and takes, as the name suggests, the role of a notebook. A Jupyter notebooks allows us to combine text, equations and images with functional computer code.\n",
    "In other words, Jupyter notebooks allow us to work on the computer similarly as one would using an ordinary notebook and a graphical calculator.\n",
    "Here, computer code is implemented that makes calculations and plots graphs for us. \n",
    "The most common computer languages used in Jupyter notebooks are Julia, Python and R. This explains the choice of name Ju(lia)pyt(thon)(e)r.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks provided throughout this course make use of code written in the Julia language, which is relatively simple to understand even if you have never done any programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Accessible notebooks</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are not familiar with computer code, no worries. The notebooks are meant to be accessible and <b>very little previous knowledge on computer code is required</b>.The Julia code that is used throughout these notebooks works from the get go.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making use of the <b>interactive elements</b>, you can <b>explore quantum cryptography</b> in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, <b>please click inside the box of code just below and press shift-enter.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see a slider appear that can be used to interact with the code. Shift it left and right and see what happens! If you have any problems executing this example, we recommend you go to Kernel>Restart&Clear Output and try again. If you are NOT using mybinder but a local install: if you have troubles running the interactive elements on your local installation and you are viewing this using jupyter labs, you can try to refresh the page (without restarting the kernel). If this does not work for you, please use jupyter notebook instead of jupyter labs to run the sheets that have interactive elements."
