Welcome! 

We hope these notebooks will help you sharpen your understanding of quantum 
cryptography by letting you experiment and gain intuition. Making such notebooks and 
instructions takes quite some time, and we debated whether it is at all wise to make 
them available alongside this book. We chose to do this anyways, as we believe they 
can be greatly helpful in helping you explore and gain intuition about quantum 
cryptography.

However, please note that the Julia Jupyter Notebooks for this book and associated materials
are provided AS IS. In particular, please understand we are not available for any form of 
IT support, nor will we necessarily update these notebooks to any future versions of Julia 
or associated packages.

Please see the instructions for executing these Notebooks locally, as well as online 
on MyBinder. If you have never used Jupyter notebooks before, we recommend using MyBinder. 

Enjoy!
Stephanie
